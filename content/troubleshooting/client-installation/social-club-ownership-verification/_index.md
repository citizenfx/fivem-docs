[error](/sc-ownership-validation.png)

Cause
-------
This is normal on first launch after installing FiveM, if you see this, it most likely means FiveM did not detect Steam running.

Resolution
-------
Login with your Social Club account that you purchased Grand Theft Auto with to verify you own the game.

If you bought the game through Steam, see [here](/troubleshooting/client-installation/social-club-account-does-not-own-valid-licence/)
