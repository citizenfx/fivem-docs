![error](/sc-doesnt-own-game.png)

Cause
-------
Should be self-explanitory... (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

- Steam is not running
- FiveM is not detecting Steam
- The Social Club account you signed-in to doesn't own Grand Theft Auto

Resolution
-------
- If you own the Steam version, you need to have Steam open (running in online mode) before starting FiveM.
    - Try closing FiveM and restarting Steam.

- If you own the Social Club version, you need to purchase Grand Theft Auto first.
