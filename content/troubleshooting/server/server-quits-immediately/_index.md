title: Server quits immediately
---

 You need to be in the ``server-data`` folder (or whatever you named it).
 
 And you __DON'T__ run the ``run.cmd`` file directly!

 From the Docs:
 
   - Windows:
   
     `Run the server from the server-data folder. (cd /d D:\FXServer\server-data)
	 D:\FXServer\run.cmd +exec server.cfg (from a new cmd window)`
   
   - Linux:

     `Run the server from the server-data folder.
	 bash /home/username/server/run.sh +exec server.cfg`
