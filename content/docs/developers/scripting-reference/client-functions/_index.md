Here is a list of some of the functions that you can use specifically in **client** side scripts.

Native functions
----------------
Native functions are provided by both the game and the Citizen framework (under the [CFX](/natives/?n_CFX) heading). Refer to the [FiveM Native Reference](/natives), where you can see syntax per language, a description, and examples for each native.

These natives are usable in **all** runtimes.

Runtime specific functions
--------------------------
Some functions are exclusive to the scripting runtime you're using, and are **not** documented
in the [FiveM Native Reference List](/natives). Refer to their docs for more detail.
