**NUI** (short for 'new UI') is the HTML-based user interface functionality in the CitizenFX framework. Currently using
the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef), it offers an asynchronous, performant way of creating in-game UI using
web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS, including frameworks like React or Angular, and accelerated WebGL).
