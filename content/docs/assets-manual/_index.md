## Beginner Series

### About This Series

This series is a step-by-step introduction to GTAV 3D modding for beginners. Across four concise guides, you'll go from a fresh setup to confidently working with GTAV assets using industry-standard tools.

These guides were created in partnership with community member [**Ook3d**](https://www.youtube.com/@ook_3D), combining practical experience and community knowledge to provide clear, beginner-friendly workflows.

We'll start by setting up the essential software, then gradually move into importing, editing, and exporting 3D content for the game. Each part builds on the previous one, so it's recommended to follow them in order.

### What You'll Learn in This Series

- How to set up and configure core modding tools
