Getting game crashes? Can't launch FiveM? Or maybe running into some more
obscure issue? Find the most common issues here.

I crash when playing on a server
--------------------------------
Crashes are fairly often related to a server-specific issue. To make sure your crash isn't related to a specific
server, it is advised to join the [vanilla FiveM server][vanilla-server]. If that server works without your issue, we
recommend you to contact the server owners of the server where you're experiencing crashes on. Otherwise, read on.

I've been banned on a server
----------------------------
FiveM is not responsible for what you do on servers, or what server admins do to you. If you believe you've been
falsely banned from a server, contact the server owners. FiveM can not and will not provide support for this matter.

I've been globally banned from FiveM
------------------------------------
That's unfortunate, don't cheat.
If you believe you've been falsely banned, you can fill out the ban report at https://forum.cfx.re/w/ban-report. This is **not a ban appeal**, but this data is used for structured collection of potential 'false positive' bans.<br />
**Please note that you may not get a response and that FiveM forum/Discord moderators can _not_ assist you with your ban.**

Could not find game executable
------------------------------

<!--<img src="/static/could-not-find-game-exec-error.png">-->
Locate the `CitizenFX.ini` file within your [FiveM Application Data][where-is-fivem-installed] and make sure it is
pointing to the correct path. Open the file with a text editor like Notepad and edit the path to your GTA V installation
if necessary.

FiveM is already installed
--------------------------
<!-- https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/455024366091108352/479267390836834306/unknown.png -->
After you installed FiveM, you don't need to use the same FiveM.exe file anymore. Use the shortcut from your Windows
start menu. Press the Start button on your taskbar and look for FiveM there.

If you uninstalled FiveM by deleting the shortcut, you might have to [uninstall][uninstalling] FiveM properly.

Game cache outdated
-------------------
<!-- https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/455024366091108352/479268603510652946/unknown.png -->
<!-- https://vgy.me/JJJzfI.png -->
Press `Yes` if the dialog asks `Do you wish to continue?`. If you get an error like `DLC files are missing`, make sure
your game is up to date by following the instructions in the dialog. Also, make sure your `CitizenFX.ini` points to
the correct GTA V installation. You can find that file within your [FiveM application data][where-is-fivem-installed].

Error generating ROS entitlement token
--------------------------------------
<!-- https://i.imgur.com/IAobS5M.png -->
Certain antivirus vendors are known to block FiveM for unknown reasons.
[Disable your antivirus][disabling-antivirus] and try again.

Error loading component xyz.dll
-------------------------------
Delete caches.xml from your [FiveM application data][where-is-fivem-installed] folder.
If there is no such file, delete the entire application data folder and run FiveM again. For `adhesive.dll` also see below.

Error loading component adhesive.dll
-------------------------------
Your Windows 10 installation is outdated. Please update it to at least version 1703. To check your current version, open command prompt and type `winver`.

Opening database (privcache:/) failed: IO error: could not lock file
------------------------------
Your privcache got corrupted. Please remove the "priv" folder from the cache folder located in your [FiveM application data][where-is-fivem-installed].

Entry Point Not Found
------------------------------
Delete `v8.dll`, `v8_libbase.dll`, `v8_libplatform.dll` if available in your `C:\Windows\system32` directory. These are (leftover) files from other applications that incorrectly use `system32` to place these files. FiveM loads dll's from `system32` first, resulting in these incorrect dll's being loaded.

Moving of xyz.exe failed (err = 32)
------------------------------
First check your taskmanager for existing fivem processes if you see them close them, if that doesnâ€™t fix the issue try [disabling your antivirus][disabling-antivirus].

Stuck on 'We're getting there and it will be worth the wait'
------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- https://prnt.sc/kj02oo -->
Often caused by aggressive antivirus settings. [Disable your antivirus][disabling-antivirus] and try again.

Stuck on a rotating splash screen
---------------------------------
Delete `%appdata%\citizenfx\ros_id.dat` and `%localappdata%\digitalentitlements`.

Stuck on a black screen
-----------------------
This is a common issue with certain NVIDIA drivers. Stay patient, it takes a minute to load. This often
happens to other games too.

Stuck on a colored background but no menu
------------------------------
This happens on specific older AMD laptop GPUs. Unfortunately, this is caused by CEF and not by FiveM. Once the issue has been fixed in CEF, FiveM will be updated too. A forum moderator has created a topic that could potentially rectify this issue. [Click here][discrete-gpu] for more info.

FiveM uninstalls itself after running it!
-----------------------------------------
This is most likely your antivirus software removing FiveM. Unfortunately some antivirus vendors falsely flag FiveM,
and remove some (or even all) FiveM files as a precaution. You can safely ignore any warnings about this.<br />
