Global Bans
-----------
Our anticheat system is a robust trip-wire style system which is automated in nature. The system detects the use of external programs that attempt to inject themselves into the FiveM client. The message will display upon the attempt to join a server and will indicate that you are globally banned as well as a timer that displays the time remaining on your ban.
- **Important**: Graphic and sound packs or modifications **do not cause global bans.**

<br/>

Why does my ban have no timer nor does it say I'm globally banned?
------------------------------------------------------------------
There is one alternate message you may receive which indicates that you need to wait out your original ban. This occurs when an individual attempts to circumvent his or her original ban in various forms, therefore it is important to simply wait out your ban, if you're unsure how long, check if you can connect to a server every 3-5 days.

<br/>

Why aren't cheaters banned instantly?
-------------------------------------
Anti-cheat bans usually come in big 'waves' and are delayed to make it harder for cheaters to figure out what mechanisms led to them getting banned.

<br/>

False Bans
----------
The anticheat system has been rigorously tested to ensure that there are incredibly few false positives. However, errors can still happen. If you truly believe you did not cheat, you can attempt to appeal it [here](https://support.cfx.re/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=1900000367054).

<br/>

Banned while testing a cheat
----------
Even if you own or develop the server, a ban imposed while testing your anti-cheat resource will remain in effect. To avoid this, you can create your own resources that will 'simulate' how a typical cheat works. If you need help, you are always welcome to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fivem).

<br/>

Unauthorized Game Server Provider (GSP)
---------------------------------------
There are situations where you may attempt to join a server and come across a message indicating that the server you're attempting to join is blocked due to it not being an authorized Game Server Provider (GSP). See the [Platform License Agreement](https://fivem.net/terms) for more information, and the [Server Hosting page](https://fivem.net/server-hosting) for a list of authorized partners.

I found cheats that are undetected! Get 'em!
-------------------------------------------
Whoa! That's unfortunate, are you sure they still are undetected? Our anticheat system bans are typically slightly delayed, within 24 hours after detection the user is banned. With that being said,
we cannot stay on top of them completely without your help, our community is our backbone. If you come across cheats that you feel are undetected and you have the actual files, please feel free to send
them to [this form](https://support.cfx.re/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=1900000367874). Additionally, take a look at [this link](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/support/resource-faq/#what-can-i-do-against-cheaters) to see what you can do to help 
fight against cheaters who may be affecting your server.
