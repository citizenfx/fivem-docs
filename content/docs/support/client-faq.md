Will FiveM run on Xbox or PlayStation?
-------------------------------------

No. FiveM is developed exclusively for the PC version of GTA V. There are no plans to support consoles.

Will FiveM run on Linux?
------------------------

There are no plans to support the FiveM client on Linux. While some components may work, full functionality is not guaranteed. The FiveM server (FXServer) is available on Linux.


Where is FiveM installed?
-------------------------

That depends on how you installed it in the first place.

- Did you run FiveM.exe in an empty folder? Then that's where FiveM is installed.
- Otherwise, FiveM installs in `%localappdata%`:
    - Press `WinKey+R` on your keyboard
    - Type `%localappdata%/FiveM` in the dialog that opens
    - Hit Enter

Will I get banned from GTA:Online for playing FiveM?
---------------------------------------

Nope! [As mentioned on fivem.net](https://fivem.net/#no-bans), FiveM does not interact with the Rockstar Online Services other than to validate your game copy the first time you launch it. This validation emulates the game's interaction, and cannot be detected by Rockstar. It also doesn't modify your game files at all, even when downloading server assets, so you don't have to do anything to move between FiveM or GTA:O.

I'm running into issues, what can I do?
---------------------------------------

It's never fun to run into problems. Read the [client issues manual][client-issues] for help.
