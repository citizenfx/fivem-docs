Here is a list of some of the functions that you can use specifically in **server** side scripts.

Native functions
----------------
Server-side native functions are provided by the Citizen framework. Refer to the [FiveM Native Reference](/natives), where you can see syntax per language, a description, and examples for each native.

These natives are usable in **all** runtimes.

Runtime specific functions
--------------------------
Some functions are exclusive to the scripting runtime you're using, and are **not** documented
in the [FiveM Native Reference List](https://docs.fivem.net/natives). Refer to their docs for more detail.
