There's a few ways to easily tell what functions exist in C# pending manual documentation:

1.  You can use Visual Studio's IntelliSense functionality to view most functions, or use the 'class browser' feature
    to view the public-exposed API.
2.  On the client, many APIs are similar to GTA V's ScriptHookV.NET API.
3.  Natives exist in `CitizenFX.Core.Native.API`, check the [native reference](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/natives/) to find out more.
