RedM requires a fully updated installation of Red Dead Redemption 2. If you do not own a legal copy of the game yet, you can buy it from any of the stores below. Of course, you can also buy the game from your preferred local retailer; these are just the most common ones.

RedM does not condone the use of pirated software and **will not work** with illegitimate versions of Red Dead Redemption 2.
