Installing FiveM is pretty straightforward. It's usually a matter of [downloading FiveM][home], then simply running the
downloaded file. For those who'd like a bit more detail, read below.

Installing
----------

Running into trouble? Make sure your system meets the [minimum requirements][system-requirements] and
read the [client issues manual][client-issues].

- Make sure you have installed and updated [GTA V][where-to-buy].
