There are many ways you can help FiveM in its development.

Developing FiveM
----------------

Want to fix a bug, create a new feature or just help us build FiveM? Read the [developer documentation][developer-docs]!
If you need any help, join us on [Discord][discord]. We're more than happy to help you.

Updating natives / docs
------------------

If working with C++ is not your thing, we're always welcoming new updates on any docs. If we see fit, we might be able to merge it!

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is an ever-ongoing piece of work. If you see any room for improvement on these docs, you can do so by
submitting a pull request on our [docs repository][docs-rep], or clicking the "Improve this page" link at the bottom of
a page.
