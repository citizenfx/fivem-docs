There are many ways you can contribute to the development and growth of FiveM. Whether you're a developer, a writer, or a supporter, your help is invaluable!

## Developing FiveM

Do you have the skills to fix bugs, create new features, or improve existing ones? Dive into our [developer documentation][developer-docs] to get started. If you need assistance, join our community on [Discord][discord] where fellow developers and enthusiasts are ready to help.

## Updating Natives

Do you love the GTA universe and want to explore its details? You can make a big impact by working with natives. Search for new ones in decompiled files or improve the descriptions of existing ones. Your contributions will help others understand and use FiveM more effectively.

## Improving Documentation

Documentation is a continual work in progress, and we always welcome improvements. If you spot any areas for improvement, you can submit a pull request on our [docs repository][docs-rep], or simply click the "Improve this page" link at the bottom of any documentation page. You can also create a Github issue to suggest new pages. Any contribution is welcome!

### Method signatures
