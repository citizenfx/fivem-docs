  Finding resources for your FiveM server.
---

Resources can be used to add functionality to your FiveM server. You can find many of the available resources on the [Cfx Marketplace](https://marketplace.cfx.re/) or in the [Releases](https://forum.cfx.re/c/development/releases/7) section.

Some may be free and others may not. The forum has filtering functionality so you can sort through them.

{{% alert color="warning" title="Dependencies" %}}Some resources may have dependencies, which means they might rely on other resources (so do your research prior to picking a resource, or things may not work). Resources under the [**standalone**](https://forum.cfx.re/tags/c/development/releases/7/standalone) tag typically don't have this. {{% /alert %}}

## Responsibility

Use at your own risk. Resources are community-driven and you should pick them carefully. FiveM is not responsible for any events following their use and will not provide support for community-made resources. Make sure to follow the resource terms and conditions. Resources generally have a way to communicate with the creator for support. Use the available channels if an issue arises.

{{% alert color="warning" title="Paid Resources" %}}Some resources may be paid. If you opt to pay for a resource, please contact the seller first and ask them if they're selling the resource via the [Cfx Marketplace](https://marketplace.cfx.re/) or [Tebex](https://www.tebex.io/fivem) to avoid scams. FiveM does not hold itself accountable for paid resources and you should be diligent and careful prior to purchasing anything online. {{% /alert %}}
