## What are Featured Servers?

Featured servers are a list of curated servers displayed on the right side of the FiveM server list.<br>
Generally speaking, featured servers are accessible experiences for new players, offering fast paced gamemodes which can be understood within just a few minutes, either alone, or with your friends.<br>

## Criteria for servers to be featured

Certain criteria must be met for a server to be eligible for the featured server list:

• The server does not violate the [FiveM PLA][fivem-pla].<br>
• The server offers a non-roleplay setting.<br>
• The server’s language is either English or offers support for multiple languages.<br>
• The server receives regular updates and is well maintained.<br>
• Players can connect to the server directly by pressing the "connect" button. No additional limitations should be enforced (e.g., requiring players to join a Discord server or be added to an allowlist).<br>

## Reasons for removal from the featured server list

• The server violates the [FiveM PLA][fivem-pla].<br>
• The server has changed its core gameplay mechanics or shifted the gameplay loop.<br>
• The server is empty and no longer provides the same gameplay experience for the community.<br>
• The server is abandoned and no longer receives regular updates.<br>
• The server is unreachable or players are unable to connect.<br>
