  A step-by-step guide on setting up FXServer.
---

FXServer is the name of the Cfx.re platform server. This page shows you how to run it.

Having trouble running your server? Visit [server issues][server-issues], use the Discord [#server-talk][fxserver-support] channel or create a topic in the [Server Discussion][fxserver-support-category] sub-category on the forum.

## Before you begin
Make sure you have registered a license key on the [Cfx.re Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/) service. You need to have the IP match the *public* IP on which you're going to *first* use the key. Afterwards, the key can be used on any IP, but only on one server at a time.

## Ultimate easy setup guide

### Windows
#### Download the server
1. Download and install [Visual C++ Redistributable 2019][vcredist] or newer.
2. Go to the [artifacts server][windows-artifacts].
3. Download the latest recommended build.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step-2.png)
4. Open the `server.zip` you just downloaded.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step-3.png)
5. Extract it somewhere you want to store it. We'll pick `C:\FXServer\artifact`.<br>

6. Open the folder you just extracted it to. It should look a little like this:<br>

#### Start the server
1. Double click `FXServer.exe`.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step2-1.png)
2. This site should open in your browser. Make sure a PIN is filled, and click `Link Account`.<br>

3. Log in to your account on [Cfx.re](https://forum.cfx.re/) in this tab and then click `Yes, Allow`.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step2-3.png)
4. Set a password to log in to your server's admin page.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step2-4.png)
5. Click 'Next'.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step2-5.png)
6. Type a name for your server and click 'Next'.
7. Select to use a 'Popular Template'.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step2-7.png)
8. Pick the 'CFX Default' template for now. Other templates may exist, but some will require a database server.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step2-8.png)
9. Click 'Save' or select another path.
10. Go to the 'Recipe Deployer'.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step2-10.png)
11. Click 'Next' once you're sure the recipe looks fine. It should be fine the way it comes.<br>
  ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step2-11.png)
12. Enter the key you just made on the Keymaster in the 'Before you begin' step and click 'Run Recipe'.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step2-12.png)
13. If everything's correct, you can click 'Next' again.<br>
   ![pic](/server-setup/windows-step2-13.png)
14. ... and finally, "Save & Run Server", and you're done!<br>

## Traditional installation steps

### Windows

#### Prerequisites
1. [Visual C++ Redistributable 2019][vcredist] or newer.
2. [Git][git-scm] to assure a correct installation.

#### Installation
1. Create a new directory (for example `D:\FXServer\server`), this will be used for the server binaries.
2. Download the current recommended `master` branch build for Windows from the [artifacts server][windows-artifacts].
3. Extract the build into the directory previously created.
  <br>3b. Use any archiving tool (such as WinRAR or 7-Zip).
4. Clone [cfx-server-data][server-data] in a new folder outside of your server binaries folder, for example, `D:\FXServer\server-data`.
  <br>4b. `git clone https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data.git server-data`
5. Make a **server.cfg** file in your `server-data` folder (copy the [example server.cfg](#servercfg) file below into that file).
6. Set the license key in your server.cfg using `sv_licenseKey "licenseKeyGoesHere"`.
7. Run the server from the `server-data` folder. For example, in a plain Windows command prompt (cmd.exe) window: 
    ```dos
    cd /d D:\FXServer\server-data
    D:\FXServer\server\FXServer.exe +exec server.cfg
    ```

    (the `/d` flag is only needed when changing directory to somewhere on a different drive)

### Linux
{{% alert theme="info" %}}Note that the Linux version of FXServer is only provided as a courtesy port due to issues regarding Linux distribution compatibility and availability of diagnostic tools for native C++ code.
If you're experiencing any issues, you're more likely to see them fixed if you use the Windows version.
{{% /alert %}}

1. Create a new folder (for example `mkdir -p /home/username/FXServer/server`), this will be used for the server binaries.
2. Download the current recommended `master` branch build for Linux from the [artifacts server][linux-artifacts](copy the URL for the latest server version and use `wget <url>` to download it).
3. Extract the build to the directory that was previously created, using `cd /home/username/FXServer/server && tar xf fx.tar.xz` (you need to have `xz` installed, on Debian/Ubuntu this is in the `xz-utils` package).
4. Clone [cfx-server-data][server-data] in a new folder outside of your server binaries folder.
  <br>4b. For example `git clone https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data.git /home/username/FXServer/server-data`
5. Make a **server.cfg** file in your `server-data` folder (copy the [example server.cfg](#servercfg) file below into that file).
6. Set the license key in your `server.cfg` using `sv_licenseKey "licenseKeyGoesHere"`.
7. Run the server from the `server-data` folder.
  <br>7b. `bash /home/username/FXServer/server/run.sh +exec server.cfg`

### Common issues

- If you don't get any 'resources found', and it says 'Failed to start resource', you didn't 'cd' to the right folder.
- If no resources get started, and you can't connect, you didn't add +exec.
- If you get 'no license key was specified', one of the above things applies.
