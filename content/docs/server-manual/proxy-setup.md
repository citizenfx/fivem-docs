  A basic set of steps to configure a proxy frontend for the Cfx.re server.
---

At times, it may be desirable to have a reverse proxy in front of your Cfx.re server instance. This guide will discuss the requirements for such a setup.

## Connection process
The client->server connection process is as follows:

1. Client resolves the _connect endpoint_ from the join interaction. This can be any of the following:
   * The `connectEndPoints` field in the server listing output, which can be configured using `sv_listingHostOverride`.
   * The server address cached by the join URL subsystem, such as from history.
   * An IP, host or URL entered in a `connect` command. These get processed as follows:
     * Bare hosts/IPs: `host.example` will resolve to `http://host.example:30120/`.
     * Hosts with port: `host.example:30121` resolve to `http://host.example:30121/`.
     * URLs with scheme: `http://host.example/` and `https://host.example/` will be resolved as-is, using the default ports for HTTP and HTTPS (80/443).
2. Client retrieves general server metadata via a `GET /info.json` on the connect endpoint.
3. Client attempts an `initConnect` request to the connect endpoint's `POST /client`.
4. If server accepts client, it'll send a connection token to client.
5. Client requests `getEndpoints` on the connect endpoint, receiving one or more IP/port combos. If multiple are specified, it will pick one to use as the server endpoint.
6. Client requests `getConfiguration` on the server endpoint. This will then result in one or more requests to `GET /files/*` on either the server endpoint or a file server override.
7. Client sends a UDP info request to the server endpoint.
8. Client sends an ENet connect request, as well as a UDP handshake to the server endpoint. If accepted, the client now has an ENet peer.
9. Client starts loading the game.
10. Client potentially opens additional sideband TCP/UDP channels to the server endpoint, potentially using other protocols via the multiplex.

## Proxy types
There are two different reverse proxy types that would make sense in this system, and either can be set up independently from the other.

One is the **connect endpoint**, which can be replaced with any commodity HTTPS reverse proxy/load balancer on port `443`, leading to the actual server's TCP port. The other is the **server endpoint**, which needs a raw TCP/UDP proxy on matching ports leading to the actual server's TCP/UDP port.

### Connect proxy

For a connection proxy, a setup like the following could work (based on [a community guide](https://gist.github.com/nathanctech/e648f8312ad0d599fbb3a28db7e4c8f0)):

* Cloudflare set up with a domain you own, adding an entry for, say, `server1.example.com` as a proxied A/CNAME record to a machine you control.
* nginx installed on the user-controlled machine (which does not have to be the main server: it can be a budget VPS running Linux even for a Windows server), having a host entry for `server1.example.com`, as follows:
    ```
    upstream backend {
        # use the actual server IP here, or if separate, a proxy server
        server 100.64.1.2:30120;
    }

    # assuming this path exists
    proxy_cache_path /srv/cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=assets:48m max_size=20g inactive=2h;

    server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

        server_name server1.example.com;

        # this can also be a Cloudflare origin certificate if you're using CF
        ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem;

        location / {
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            # required to pass auth headers correctly
            proxy_pass_request_headers on;
            # required to not make deferrals close the connection instantly
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }

        # extra block for a caching proxy
        location /files/ {
            proxy_pass http://backend$request_uri;
            add_header X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status;
            proxy_cache_lock on;
            proxy_cache assets;
            proxy_cache_valid 1y;
            proxy_cache_key $request_uri$is_args$args;
            proxy_cache_revalidate on;
            proxy_cache_min_uses 1;
        }
    }
    ```
* The following values in your server configuration:
    ```bash
    # prevents the server list from advertising your server using its actual IP
    set sv_forceIndirectListing true

    # makes the server list backend request `https://server1.example.com/` instead of the default
    set sv_listingHostOverride "server1.example.com"

    # a space-separated list of IPv4 networks in CIDR notation to allow 'X-Real-IP'
    # from, as well as bypass the rate limiter
    set sv_proxyIPRanges "100.64.1.1/32"

    # the actual endpoint your server is hosted on, or one
    # or multiple server endpoint proxies as noted below
    set sv_endpoints "100.64.1.2:30120"

    # some guides also mention `sv_listingIpOverride`, this value is only needed if the server list backend
    # can't guess the IP to query itself, and is not provided to any front-end connection.
    #
    # this is usually the case for systems with multiple IPs, or if the server is firewalled off for all hosts except
    # a server proxy.
    ```
* If wanting to set up a caching proxy too, the following would be helpful as well:
    ```bash
    # obfuscates files with a global key, instead of a per-client key
    set adhesive_cdnKey "yourSecret"

    # adds a file server for 'all' resources
    fileserver_add ".*" "https://server1.example.com/files"
    ```

A working setup of this example would have the following URLs accessible correctly in the browser:
- https://server1.example.com/info.json
- https://server1.example.com/players.json
- https://server1.example.com/dynamic.json
- https://server1.example.com/client (should show '/client is POST only')

Note that, at this time, `connect` command usage has to use `connect "https://server1.example.com/"` or a join URL, it will not attempt to look up a bare domain as a URL.

### Server proxy

If you also wish to proxy the raw TCP/UDP endpoints, the Nginx 'stream' module can be used as follows (this is not valid in a typical `sites-enabled` file, it has to be directly in a `conf.d` or `nginx.conf`):

```
stream {
    upstream backend {
        server 100.64.1.2:30120;
    }
    server {
		listen 30120;
		proxy_pass backend;
	}
	server {
		listen 30120 udp reuseport;
		proxy_pass backend;
	}
}
```

When setting this up, also configure `sv_endpoints` appropriately.

## Advanced setups
This setup can have a few variations as well:

* One could add the load balancer to a Kubernetes cluster as a proper ingress.
* If specifying a proper `location` block (e.g. a regular expression), the domain could be shared with, say, a web site.
* Implementing a custom handler for `/client` initConnect requests and delegating a successful connection to the actual backend server's `initConnect` sequence. This could be used for a server picker or some other creative things.

## Local TLS Proxy

The local TLS Proxy setup can be useful if you can't tunnel the TLS traffic with services like CloudFlare, but you still have to protect the FXServer against specific TLS attacks. 
This guide is using nginx as a example, but you can setup any other reverse proxy such as [traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) or [envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) as well.

### TCP Endpoint port change

First you need to change the tcp endpoint on the server to use a different port. In this sample we use 30121 as the none public accessible port that the FXServer is using.
Usually you will find the `endpoint_add_tcp` defined inside your `server.cfg`. After you found it change its parameter to `"0.0.0.0:30121"`.
```
endpoint_add_tcp "0.0.0.0:30121"
```

Make sure to specify the `endpoint_add_udp` above the `endpoint_add_tcp`, otherwise this port change will not work correctly.
```
endpoint_add_udp "0.0.0.0:30120"
endpoint_add_tcp "0.0.0.0:30121"
```

### Nginx configuration

The next step is to configure nginx to redirect the incoming TLS traffic from the external accessible 30120 port to the internal 30121 port. 

```
server {
    listen 30120 ssl;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:30121;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

As you can see inside the configuration an `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` is required.

The easiest way is to use an self signed certificates when you don't have a domain name associated with your server ip.
When you have a domain already configured you can setup [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) to generate this for you.

On Linux the easiest way to generate self signed certificates is using `openssl`.
```
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
```

For Windows a openssl Binary can be found at [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries).
Which works the same as the Linux Version.
```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout nginx-selfsigned.key -out nginx-selfsigned.crt
```

### Block 30121 port access

As an last step you have to block the 30121 port to be accessible from the outside.
When the server host supports a custom firewall configuration inside the configuration panel use that.
Otherwise rely on the different operating system implementations.

For linux using `iptables`:
```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 30121 -j DROP
```

For linux using `ufw`:
```
sudo ufw deny 30121/tcp
```

For windows using `PowerShell`:
```
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block TCP Port 30121" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 30121 -Action Block
```

For windows using `netsh`:
```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block TCP Port 30121" dir=in action=block protocol=TCP localport=30121
```
