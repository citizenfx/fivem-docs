A game server hosting provider offers the fastest and easiest way to set up a FiveM server. Check out our list of authorized partners on the [Server Hosting](https://fivem.net/server-hosting) page.

To get started, pick your provider of choice, and create an account.

Remember that to use more than 48 slots, you will need [FiveM Element Club Argentum 💿][subscription-join] or above, which can be obtained from the [Cfx.re Portal][portal].
> You'll need to add the license key associated with your Cfx.re account to your server instance.
