## ZAP-Hosting setup steps

1. Access the [ZAP-Hosting website][zap-hosting-website] and login into to your account or sign-up if you don't have one.
2. Click on [Rent a server][zap-rent-a-server] on the top left of the screen (navigation bar)
3. A dialog will show where you can `Choose your product`. We will be using a Cloud Gameserver, so click `Gameserver` followed by `Cloud Gameserver`.
4. A new page will show, scroll down until you find `Search for games`, enter `FiveM`. We will be using `FIVE: FiveM Mod (Windows)`, so make sure to click on it. Optionally, you can [click this link][zap-rent-a-windows-server].
5. Pick the server location, we're going to be using a server located in Germany for this example.
6. Scroll down and customize your server to your liking, remember that to use more than 48 slots, you will need [FiveM Element Club Argentum ðŸ’¿][subscription-join] or above, which can be obtained from the Cfx.re Portal.
    - If you plan to get a subscription through the Cfx.re Portal, you should register your server with the same email address as the one used for your Cfx.re account, so that your plan is automatically detected and configured.
    - When hosting a server with ZAP-Hosting, you'll need to add the license key associated to your Cfx.re account to your server instance. You may find the guide [here][zap-hosting-license-key-guide].
7. Choose your preferred payment method and agree to the terms, remember to be logged in as detailed on `Step 1`.
8. Once you confirm the order, the server will be up. Once the server is up an `Initial installation will be required` dialog should be shown, click on `Install`.
9. You should now be able to access your game-panel where an IP address will be shown, copy it to access your game-server.
10. Copy the IP and launch FiveM. Once FiveM is open, press F8 on your keyboard to bring up the game console. Type `connect [your-server-ip]` and you should be able to connect if the server is running.
