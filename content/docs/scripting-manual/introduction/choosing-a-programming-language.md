Getting started with scripting in FiveM might be a tad overwhelming, with FiveM's extensive support for multiple programming languages it might be hard to choose which one you want to use, or which one you _should_ use. In this quick and simple guide, we'll try to help you make this decision. Let's break this down from a fundamental standpoint.

## [Lua](/scripting-manual/runtimes/lua)
Lua is great for beginners, there is amazing documentation on Lua, but there is plenty on the others as well. Lua has by far the most resources made out of it due to it being the simplest and fastest to put resources together.

## [C#](/scripting-manual/runtimes/csharp)
C# is really good for more advanced users to make resources, due to C# having what is considered at least more difficult syntax, and, compared to Lua, more tedious build process (although still really easy if you follow [documentation](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-manual/runtimes/csharp/)) it can benefit you greatly.

## [JavaScript(JS)](/scripting-manual/runtimes/javascript)
The primary use of JavaScript that is seen in FiveM is performing HTTP requests, or anything NUI/UI Related, [Dop3t](https://forum.cfx.re/u/d0p3t/) made a [TS/JS wrapper](https://forum.cfx.re/t/fivem-js-v1-5-2-javascript-typescript-wrapper-now-with-menu-class-nativeui/268640) for FiveM which is immensely well documented, and has a ton of great features, especially UI related stuff.

## Conclusion
So in conclusion, it depends, we recommend Lua to you if you've never coded before and just want to learn, download resources off the [forums](https://forum.cfx.re/), and tinker with them, you'll learn the language very quickly. **Lua** is a concise and lightweight dynamically typed language, which is easy to pick up, **C#** has static typing and object orientation, for the most _advanced_ projects and with **Javascript** you can use your existing web development knowledge and the rich package/tooling ecosystem.
