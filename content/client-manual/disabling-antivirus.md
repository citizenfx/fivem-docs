Some antivirus vendors like Avast, AVG and others are known to block FiveM procedures. Make sure your antivirus allows
FiveM to run by adding FiveM to its exclusions list. We are aware of the situation and are intending to work on a
solution for these issues.

- First, locate where FiveM is installed.
    - If you installed FiveM in an empty folder, that's where you installed FiveM.
    - Otherwise:
        - Press `WinKey+R` on your keyboard
        - Type `%localappdata%\FiveM` in the dialog that opens
        - Hit enter
- Copy the path to your FiveM folder.
- Add it to your antivirus exclusions. For the common antivirus vendors:
    - [Avast](https://support.avast.com/en-eu/article/Antivirus-scan-exclusions)
    - [AVG](https://support.avg.com/SupportArticleView?urlname=How-to-exclude-file-folder-or-website-from-AVG-scanning)
    - [Windows Defender](https://www.wikihow.com/Turn-Off-Windows-Defender-in-Windows-10)
    - [Norton](https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v3672136_ns_retail_en_us)
    - [kaspersky](https://support.kaspersky.com/12160)

  Same case with disabling antiviruses don't actually disable when the user specifically says that it wants it disabled. So to be sure and it will run. uninstalling is probably a better solution for third-party antiviruses.
     
 enjoy FiveM.
